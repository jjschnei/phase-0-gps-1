##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
While I wasn’t struggling with any particular concept, I lacked overall confidence using Git / GitHub.  Having to remember the commands while two people were watching made me even slower. However, by the end of the session my confidence had increased.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concept of having multiple people work on one file became a lot more clear.  This was the first time that I had used GitHub with another person. Having two people work on the same files really shows the importance of version control.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about best practices as well as specific questions about git commands I could not remember.

##What still confuses you about git?
I still need more practice making sure that all of my local files match all of my GitHub files.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a lot of fun. It’s great to interact with other people going through the same process. I look forward to doing it more and for coming onsite.
