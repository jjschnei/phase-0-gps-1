**1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

	I was struggling with the concept of pull requests and why they were necessary.

**2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

	To clear up my impression of pull requests, our guide gave us a situation where I was working on a project locally, and pushed my work to GitHub.  My partner would be acting as a project manager and the pull request is me asking my work can be merged to the master with his permission.  We also learned about conflicts between branches and how to resolve them.

**3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

	We asked a lot of questions clarifying commands, and combinations of those commands.  We learned that "git pull" acts as a combination of "git fetch remote branch" and "git merge remote/branch"

**4. What still confuses you about git?**

	I think I'm still confused with how this works with multiple developers, but I guess that's something I'll just have to see or experience for myself.  

**5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

	My experience was pretty good, my partner had a good handle on the material and our guide was very helpful when he needed to be.
